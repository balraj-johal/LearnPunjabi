# LearnPunjabi

Learn Punjabi is an in-development application that will make it easier for non-native speakers to learn Punjabi and its alphabet Gurmukhi.

Punjabi is a language spoken by >10 million people worldwide that is underserved in popular culture.

## Github Project Tracker
I am currently working towards a feature-complete MVP with a small amount of initial content.

https://github.com/users/balraj-johal/projects/2

## Access
The project is currently hosted for development/testing purposes at https://www.learn-punjabi-alphabet.herokuapp.com.

Once the first MVP milestone has been reached the site will be moved to a custom domain and become publically available.
