# LearnPunjabi
Learn Punjabi is an educational platform that will make it easier for non-native speakers to learn Punjabi and its alphabet Gurmukhi.

Punjabi is a language spoken by >10 million people worldwide that is underserved in popular culture and not taught on other popular platforms, such as Duolingo.

## Project Status
The project is currently targeting a production-ready release with a small set of initial lessons.

Once the first release milestone is hit, the platform will be expanded with more content and lesson task types, including a planned AI character recognition task type to allow users to better learn character forms.
